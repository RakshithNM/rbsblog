I started learning vim sometime ago and now use it all the time.

I use the following plugins:
* [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - for fuzzy file finding
* [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - for pattern searching
* [COC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) - for code completion
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) - for status bar
* [indentLine](https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine) - to display indentation levels with thin vertical lines
* [spacecamp](https://github.com/jaredgorski/SpaceCamp) - as my colortheme
